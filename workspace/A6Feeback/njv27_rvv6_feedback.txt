# A6 feedback for njv27_rvv6

This is Grace, grading your submission for A6.  You are implicitly awarded points (up to 100) for code that satisfies the requirements of the assignment.  If a requirement is not satisfied, a points deduction will be listed here under the appropriate heading, along with the text of the requirement (phrased in terms of what your code _should_ have done) and possibly some clarifying comments.  Additionally, penalties may be deducted for general errors (these are phrased in terms of what your code _shouldn't_ have done).  At the bottom is your total score.
