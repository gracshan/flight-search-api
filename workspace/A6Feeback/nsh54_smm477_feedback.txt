# A6 feedback for nsh54_smm477

This is Grace, grading your submission for A6.  You are implicitly awarded points (up to 100) for code that satisfies the requirements of the assignment.  If a requirement is not satisfied, a points deduction will be listed here under the appropriate heading, along with the text of the requirement (phrased in terms of what your code _should_ have done) and possibly some clarifying comments.  Additionally, penalties may be deducted for general errors (these are phrased in terms of what your code _shouldn't_ have done).  At the bottom is your total score.

Deductions for TODO 6:
* -1: Tests `isHit`
* -1: Sets color to blue otherwise
* -1: Upper-left corner of circle is (`x-radius`,`y-radius`)
* -1: Width and height of circle are `2*radius`

Deductions for TODO 7:
* -2: Tests whether Euclidian distance between (x,y) and (cx,cy) is <= radius
  > Should check (cx - x) * (cx - x) + (cy - y) * (cy - y) <= radius * radius

Total: 94 / 100
